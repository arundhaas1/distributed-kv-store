# Distributed Key-Value Store

A Java implementation of a distributed KV store built from first principles — consensus, durability, and sharding.

> **Status:** 🚧 In active development · Day 11 of 14 · 115 tests green

## Goals

- **Durability** — writes survive crashes (Write-Ahead Log + snapshots)
- **Consensus** — 3-node replicated state machine with Raft
- **Sharding** — keys distributed across nodes via consistent hashing
- **Failure tolerance** — survives node crashes + network partitions

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java 11
- **Build:** Maven
- **Testing:** JUnit 5

## Architecture (so far)

```
   client.put("user:42", "Alice")
              │
              ▼
        ┌──────────┐
        │  Router  │   ← consistent-hash routing
        └─────┬────┘
              │ ring.getNodeForKey("user:42") → "node-2"
              ▼
   ┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
   │ KvStore  │ KvStore  │ KvStore  │
   │  node-1  │  node-2  │  node-3  │
   │          │          │          │
   │  WAL +   │  WAL +   │  WAL +   │
   │ snapshot │ snapshot │ snapshot │
   └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

- **HashRing** — TreeMap-backed ring with 32 virtual nodes per physical node. O(log N) key→node lookup.
- **Router** — hides cluster topology behind a single put/get/delete API.
- **KvStore** — single-node store. WAL append + fsync per write, periodic snapshots every 1000 writes, atomic temp+rename for snapshots.
- **WAL** — line-delimited log, fsynced on every write. `reset()` truncates after a snapshot is durable.
- **Snapshot** — pipe-delimited key/value file. Atomic rename so partial writes never corrupt prior snapshot.

## Test coverage

| Suite                         | Tests | What it proves |
| ----------------------------- | ----: | -------------- |
| `KvStoreTest`                 |    22 | Basic ops, NPE, WAL integration, lifecycle, snapshot+WAL recovery contract |
| `SnapshotTest`                |    16 | Round-trip, atomicity (no `.tmp` leak), overwrite, missing/malformed file handling, unicode, 10K volume |
| `WALTest`                     |    11 | Append, fsync, reset, close |
| `HashRingTest`                |     8 | Distribution within ±10% across 3 nodes (10K keys), redistribution only of affected keys on add/remove |
| `RouterTest`                  |     8 | Route determinism, distribution, persistence per-node, close+reopen recovery |
| `RaftNodeTest`                |    36 | State transitions, term/votedFor invariants, election + heartbeat timers, RequestVote + AppendEntries receiver rules |
| `InProcessRaftTransportTest`  |     3 | Peer registration, RPC routing to handler, unknown-peer error |
| `LeaderElectionTest`          |     6 | 3-node majority win, minority stay-candidate, higher-term step-down, leader handoff across terms |
| `HeartbeatTest`               |     5 | Heartbeat suppresses follower elections, candidate concedes on same-term heartbeat, leader steps down on higher term, stale leader rejected |
| **Total**                     | **115** | |

## Running Locally

```bash
mvn clean test
```

Expected: `Tests run: 115, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0`.

## Notable design decisions

- **Atomic snapshot via temp+rename** — `Files.move(..., ATOMIC_MOVE, REPLACE_EXISTING)` ensures a crash mid-write never corrupts the previous snapshot.
- **Snapshot first, then truncate WAL** — order matters. If the order were reversed, a crash between truncate and snapshot would lose every write since the previous snapshot.
- **WAL replay is idempotent on top of snapshot** — re-applying the same PUTs/DELETEs converges to the same state, so a crash between snapshot and truncate is recoverable.
- **32 virtual nodes per physical node** — empirically gives ±10% distribution across 3 nodes; 256 vnodes would tighten this further but cost more memory.

## Future improvements

- Hybrid snapshot trigger (count + WAL-size + time) — currently count-only, idle workloads can accumulate stale WAL.
- Replication factor > 1 (Day 12) — currently single replica per shard, so disk loss = data loss for that shard.
- gRPC between nodes (post-Day 14) — today's "cluster" is in-process simulation.
